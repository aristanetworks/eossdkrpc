The gRPC interface that the agent supports closely matches the interface provided by EosSdk, and the intent is that the <code>.proto</code> interface will be publicly supported. As well as potentially allowing for remote access, using protobuf to specify the interface isolates customer code from the Linux ABI issues that come with building C++ applications on different compiler, libc and kernel versions.</p> <p>The default listen port is <code>9543</code> but this can be changed to allow external access. Encrypted access is supported for EosSdkRpc agents configured via the <code>management api eos-sdk-rpc</code> CLI. An ACL should be used to limit the hosts that have access to the agent.</p> <p>The API mirroring is intended to be modular in the same fashion as the SDK itself. Each proto file mirrors one specific SDK module and the RPC definitions and messages also aim to be as close as possible to the original SDK API call, in an attempt to make the learning gap as small as possible.</p> <p>For performance reasons, \u201csetter\u201d RPC calls also come with bulk versions, which minimizes the RPC overhead. These calls differ from their original counterparts by providing a sequence of individual operations which are performed in batches, without requiring a round-trip to the client for each operation.</p> <p>Multiple clients are supported by EosSdkRpc and most state is shared between these clients. Requests are fulfilled without regard to which client invoked the RPC call.</p>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","text":""},{"location":"faq/#general-grpc-questions","title":"General gRPC questions","text":""},{"location":"faq/#can-i-use-grpc-with-languages-other-than-c-and-python","title":"Can I use gRPC with languages other than C++ and Python?","text":"<p>Yes! gRPC supports many programming languages, including C++, Python, Go and C#.

A gRPC channel uses one HTTP/2 connection, and all concurrent calls are multiplexed on that single connection. If the amount of active calls hits the connection stream limit, any additional calls made will be added to a queue in the client. These calls in the queue must wait for other active calls to complete before they are sent.</p> <p>See: https://grpc.io/docs/guides/performance/</p>"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-the-maximum-message-size","title":"What is the maximum message size?","text":"<p>The max message size in gRPC is limited to 4MB by default.

The gRPC interface that the agent supports closely matches the interface provided by EosSdk, and the intent is that the .proto interface can be publicly supported. As well as potentially allowing for remote access, using protobuf to specify the interface isolates customer code from the Linux ABI issues that come with building C++ applications on different compiler, libc, and kernel versions.</p> <p>The default listen point for the agent is <code>localhost:9543</code> but this can be changed to allow external access. Only encrypted access is supported for EosSdkRpc agents configured via the <code>management api eos-sdk-rpc</code> CLI. An ACL should be used to limit the hosts that have access to the agent.</p> <p>The API mirroring is intended to be modular in the same fashion as the SDK itself. Each proto file mirrors one specific SDK module and the RPC definitions and messages also aim to be as close as possible to the original SDK API call, in an attempt to make the learning gap as small as possible.</p> <p>For performance reasons, \u201csetter\u201d RPC calls also come with bulk versions, which minimizes the RPC overhead. These calls differ from their original counterparts by providing a sequence of individual operations which are performed locally in batches, without requiring a round-trip to the client for each operation.</p> <p>Multiple clients are supported by EosSdkRpc and all state is shared between these clients.

The RPC SDK has been designed to behave similarly. For functions that are not bulk calls, the SDK exceptions are translated into gRPC errors and the original error messages are also sent back to the client. gRPC\u2019s framework may also translate these into exceptions back in the client. Here is a list of the SDK exception classes and their gRPC error counterparts:</p> EOS SDK exception class Error code equivalent eos::invalid_range_error OUT_OF_RANGE eos::invalid_argument_error INVALID_ARGUMENT eos::configuration_error FAILED_PRECONDITION eos::unsupported_error UNIMPLEMENTED eos::error INTERNAL std::exception UNKNOWN <p>For the bulk RPC calls, the return structures share the same fields: one counter called processed and a structure called <code>status</code>. The works here are pretty similar to the standard C library: processed means the number of successful calls (like the return value for a call) and <code>status</code> is much like <code>errno</code>. If something went wrong, it holds the cause for the failure.</p>"},{"location":"guides/howto/#simple-c-client","title":"Simple C++ client","text":"<p>One key benefit of the modularized API is that the client does not need to generate every possible interface if it is just going to use one. Here is how to create a simple C++ client that uses the EAPI interface to run the command \u201cshow version\u201d. For the purposes of this demonstration, the requirements are gRPC and Protobuf development packages plus CMake for building.</p> <p>First thing we need to do is to obtain the current proto files. Since they are present in the router, we can just scp them:</p> <pre><code>mkdir EosRpcClient\ncd EosRpcClient\nscp -Cr root@&lt;router&gt;:/usr/share/EosSdkRpc/proto/ .\n</code></pre> <p>This will result in a directory proto being created under our root. Now we have to compile the proto files that we are interested in. We\u2019ll just use <code>eapi.proto</code> and <code>eapi_types.proto</code>. The first file contains messages and rpc definitions so it needs to be processed by protobuf and grpc generators. The second file only contains structures so protobuf is enough.</p> <p>CMake has a good integration with Protobuf and already provides a convenient way to generate C++ files and headers.
