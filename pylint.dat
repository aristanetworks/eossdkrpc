# This file was created by a4 pylint. It contains a dictionary of acceptable
# pylint complaints for files in this package. If there are conflicts, the
# easiest thing to do is to run "a4 pylint --resolve," which will resolve all
# pylint.dat conflicts in the current workspace.
# To skip files that match a given regular expression, you can add an entry to
# the dictionary below whose key is "skipRe" and whose value is a list of
# regular expressions. Examples:
#    "skipRe": [ "." ], # Skip all files
#    "skipRe": [ "ptest/" ], # Skip all files in ptest
#    "skipRe": [ "Gpio.py" ], # Skip Gpio.py (but not ptest/Gpio.py)
#    "skipRe": [ "ptest/", "Gpio.py" ], # Skip all files in ptest and Gpio.py
