# Arista's EOS SDK RPC protofiles

This repository holds protofiles and documentation for EOS SDK RPC.

A website with full documentation is hosted at: https://aristanetworks.github.io/eossdkrpc.

## Previewing the documentation website

The documentation website can be built and run locally to preview new changes.

```sh
# create and enter a python virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the website locally and open the preview link in a browser
$ mkdocs serve
[...]

[...]
```

By default, the former does include the API reference (only guides, FAQ, and general structure/look).

### Previewing the API reference

The API reference is not source controlled in this repository as it gets auto-generated by the GitHub CI.

After each CI run, all documentation files generated from protofiles are uploaded.
They can be retrieved from the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/aristanetworks/eossdkrpc/actions).
The downloaded files should then be unzipped to `docs/api-reference/`. The website can then be re-run.
