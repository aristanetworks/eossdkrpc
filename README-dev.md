### Previewing the API reference

The API reference is not source controlled in this repository as it gets auto-generated by the GitHub CI.

After each CI run, all documentation files generated from protofiles are uploaded.
They can be retrieved from the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/aristanetworks/eossdkrpc/actions).
The downloaded files should then be unzipped to `docs/api-reference/`. The website can then be re-run.
